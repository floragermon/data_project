Data Exploration & Cleaning
Identify which features (e.g., tumor size, symmetry, texture) are most correlated with cancer diagnosis.
Detect and handle missing or duplicate values in the dataset.
Perform dimensionality reduction to keep only the most important features (e.g., PCA).
2. Predicting Malignant vs. Benign Tumors
Train a classification model (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, SVM) to predict if a tumor is malignant or benign.
Compare the accuracy of different models and find the best one for this dataset.
Use cross-validation to improve model performance.
3. Feature Importance Analysis
Find out which features contribute most to the modelâ€™s prediction (e.g., mean radius, texture).
Visualize feature importance using techniques like SHAP values or permutation importance.
4. Model Optimization
Fine-tune hyperparameters of a model using GridSearchCV or RandomizedSearchCV.
Compare the trade-off between precision and recall to minimize false negatives (which are more critical in cancer detection).
5. Bias & Fairness Analysis
Check if the model performs equally well across different patient groups.
Investigate whether the dataset has imbalanced classes (more benign than malignant cases) and apply techniques like SMOTE for balancing.
6. Explainability & Interpretability
Use LIME or SHAP to explain how the model makes its predictions.
Build a decision tree visualization to understand how decisions are made.
7. Real-World Deployment Considerations
Simulate a real-world hospital scenario: If a doctor uses this model, how much confidence should they have in the predictions?
Determine the optimal threshold for classifying tumors to minimize risk.
